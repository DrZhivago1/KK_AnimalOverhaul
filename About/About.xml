	<description>&lt;b&gt;A collection of patches and tweaks regarding animals&lt;/b&gt;

	&lt;size=26&gt;-= 1.0 - "&lt;b&gt;Konrad Lorenz&lt;/b&gt;  Edition" =-&lt;/size&gt;
			&lt;i&gt;Focused on animal behavior.&lt;/i&gt; 

	- All bears, Alpacas, Ostrich, Rhinoceros, Cow, Elk, Caribou, Warg and Elephants can now be used as pack animals and will be used by other factions

	- Pets sets to follow master while doing fieldwork will now also consider DoctorRescue, ReleasePrisoner, Slaughter/Milk/Shear/Train, Harvest/Cut, Strip/Bury/Haul Corpses and CleanClearSnow as fieldwork.

	- Chinchillas, Rhinoceros, Ostriches, Turkeys, Chickens, Pigs, Cows, Rat, WildBoars, Monkey, Wargs and all wolves are now herd animals.

	- Cats and big Cats are now trainable (up to advanced like dogs) but are harder to train than most other pets (wildness raised from 0.2 to 0.5 for the pet).

	- All Bears, Foxes and Big Cats have now a "maxPreyBodySize" attribute up to their relative own body size attribute.

	- All dogs are now set to be predator (but only for the smallest animals)

	&lt;size=26&gt;-= 1.1 - "&lt;b&gt;Charles Darwin&lt;/b&gt;  Edition" =-&lt;/size&gt;
			&lt;i&gt;Focused on animal mechanics.&lt;/i&gt; 

	- Cassowaries, Emus, Iguanas, Ostriches, Tortoises, and Turkey can now lay unfertilized eggs

	- Monkeys and domestic Cats had their body-size upped in order for them to be eligible for haul training (from 0.35 to 0.40 for monkeys and from 0.26 to 0.4 for cats)

	- Elephants can now eat trees and the female elephant will also drop tusks

	- Caribous, Deers, Elks, Gazelles, Ibexes, and Rhinos will now drop horns/antlers/tusks when butchered. They are considered quite valuable for reselling and can be used as makeshift melee weapon

	- Alpacas, Deers, and Ibexes can now be milked. Ibexes produce poor-quality wool now

	- Thrumbos can now be sheared (every 50 days) for their high-quality wool

	&lt;b&gt;A big Thank you to Oblitus&lt;/b&gt; : &lt;i&gt;For "fixing" pack animals to be buyable.&lt;/i&gt; 

	&lt;b&gt;A big Thank you to Coercion&lt;/b&gt; : &lt;i&gt;For all horns and antlers graphics - Originally made for the TropiCKAPP Rainforest mod.&lt;/i&gt;
