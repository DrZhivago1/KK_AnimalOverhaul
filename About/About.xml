	<description>&lt;b&gt;A collection of patches and tweaks regarding animals&lt;/b&gt;

	&lt;size=26&gt;-= 1.0 - "&lt;b&gt;Konrad Lorenz&lt;/b&gt;  Edition" =-&lt;/size&gt;
			&lt;i&gt;Focused on animal behavior.&lt;/i&gt; 

	- All bears, Alpacas, Ostrich, Rhinoceros, Cow, Elk, Caribou, Warg and Elephants can now be used as pack animals and will be used by other factions

	- Pets sets to follow master while doing fieldwork will now also consider DoctorRescue, ReleasePrisoner, Slaughter/Milk/Shear/Train, Harvest/Cut, Strip/Bury/Haul Corpses and CleanClearSnow as fieldwork.

	- Chinchillas, Rhinoceros, Ostriches, Turkeys, Chickens, Pigs, Cows, Rat, WildBoars, Monkey, Wargs and all wolves are now herd animals.

	- Cats and big Cats are now trainable (up to advanced like dogs) but are more harder to train than most other pets (wildness raised from 0.2 to 0.5 for the pet)

	- All Bears and Big Cats have now a "maxPreyBodySize" attribute up to their relative own body size attribute.

	&lt;size=26&gt;-= 1.1 - "&lt;b&gt;Charles Darwin&lt;/b&gt;  Edition" =-&lt;/size&gt;
			&lt;i&gt;Focused on animal mechanics.&lt;/i&gt; 

	- Cassowaries, Emus, Iguanas, Ostriches, Tortoises and Turkey can now lay unfertilized eggs

	- Elephants can now eat trees and the female elephant will also drop tusks

	- Caribous, Deers, Elks, Gazelles, Ibexes and Rhinos will now drop horns, antlers or tusks when butchered. They are considered quite valuable for resell and can be used as makeshift melee weapon

	- Alpacas, Deers and Ibexes can now be milked

	- Thrumbos can now be sheared (every 50 days) for their high-quality wool




	

&lt;b&gt;A big Thank you to Oblitus&lt;/b&gt; : &lt;i&gt;For "fixing" pack animals to be buyable.&lt;/i&gt;
