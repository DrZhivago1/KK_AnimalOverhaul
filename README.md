I have updated this mod further for RimWorld v1.0, upon seeing that Ludeon user "Caffeine Zombie" took the first and largest step to updating. A collection of patches and tweaks regarding animals. Horns, pack animals, and Thrumbo upgrades.
 
My Credits:
- kaptain_kavern for the original mod.
- Ludeon Forum user "Caffeine Zombie" for the original RimWorld v1.0 update

# v1.0.3
- Labradors, Huskies, and Wolves can now be pack animals

# This latest release will be considered v1.0.2:
- I have updated Thrumbos so they can be pack animals, produce milk, nuzzle, as well as updating the wool features.
- I have altered the amounts of hay and kibble that can be consumed at once, upping the value to 200 for each.
- I have also included a patch for the mod "AnimalCollabProject" which allows; 
	- black rhinos to be Pack Animals
	- black/wooly rhino and bison horns to be harvested from corpses

# Original Mod Author's words below:

A collection of patches and tweaks regarding animals

# -= 1.1 - "__Charles Darwin__  Edition" =-
_Focused on animal mechanics_ 

- Cassowaries, Emus, Iguanas, Ostriches, Tortoises, and Turkey can now lay unfertilized eggs

- Monkeys and domestic Cats had their body-size upped in order for them to be eligible for haul training (from 0.35 to 0.40 for monkeys and from 0.26 to 0.4 for cats)

- Elephants can now eat trees and the female elephant will also drop tusks

- Caribous, Deers, Elks, Gazelles, Ibexes, and Rhinos will now drop horns/antlers/tusks when butchered. They are considered quite valuable for reselling and can be used as makeshift melee weapon

- Alpacas, Deers, and Ibexes can now be milked. Ibexes produce poor-quality wool now

- Thrumbos can now be sheared (every 50 days) for their high-quality wool


# -= 1.0 - "__Konrad Lorenz__  Edition" =-
_Focused on animal behavior_ 

- All bears, Alpacas, Ostrich, Rhinoceros, Cow, Elk, Caribou, Warg and Elephants can now be used as pack animals and will be used by other factions

- Pets sets to follow master while doing fieldwork will now also consider DoctorRescue, ReleasePrisoner, Slaughter/Milk/Shear, Harvest/Cut, Strip/Bury/Haul Corpses and CleanClearSnow as fieldwork.

- Chinchillas, Rhinoceros, Ostriches, Turkeys, Chickens, Pigs, Cows, Rat, WildBoars, Monkey, Wargs and all wolves are now herd animals.

- Cats and big Cats are now trainable (up to advanced like dogs) but are harder to train than most other pets (wildness raised from 0.2 to 0.5 for the pet).

- All Bears, Foxes and Big Cats have now a "maxPreyBodySize" attribute up to their relative own body size attribute.

- All dogs are now set to be predator (but only for the smallest animals)


## Thanks / Credits

A big Thank you to *Oblitus* : For fixing "pack animals" to be buyable.

All Horns/Antlers graphics were made by *Coercion* originally for the **TropiCKAPP Rainforest** mod

Also *Mehni* for pointing me to an error with the changes I made with cats behavior changes
